{"name":"TTY - Frontend for Software Engineering Data Analysis Platform","tagline":"Project homepage","body":"### About the project\r\nThe department of pervasive computing is developing data analysis tool for analyzing software\r\nengineering data and providing visualizations of the software engineering data produced\r\nautomatically by all different software development tools, such as JIRA, GIT, testing and\r\ncontinuous integration software. The software aims to be a useful tool in managing large\r\nsoftware projects and creating value from already existing data. The project is done in\r\nco-operation with large SW companies in Finland.\r\n\r\n### Project group\r\nMiikka Juomoja, Sami Ukkonen, Samuli Rekonen, Antti Aho, Tommi Kaipainen and Joonas Järnstedt\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
